    <h2>Whole Grains</h2>
    <p>Oats have a lot of protein per calorie, and they're easy to make. Many cats like corn, and polenta, a coarsely ground cornmeal, has a good texture for them. You can try brown rice, barley, and wheat berries, but you may need to mash them first.</p>
    <h2>Meat</h2>
    <p>Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple. They have to have protein from meat for a strong heart, good vision, and a healthy reproductive system. Cooked beef, chicken, turkey, and small amounts of lean deli meats are a great way to give them that.</p>
    <h2>Eggs</h2>
    <p>Eggs are another super source of protein for your cat. But make sure they're cooked. Like raw meat and fish, raw eggs can harm your kitty.</p>
    <h2>Fish</h2>
    <p>Fish have a lot of omega-3 fatty acids, which help your cat's eyes stay sharp as well as help with arthritis, kidney disease, and heart disorders. Canned or cooked fish is fine for a treat.</p>
    <h2>Cheese</h2>
    <p>Cheese is a high-protein snack that's fine for your cat in small amounts. But the protein in cheese is less complete than the kind in meat, fish, and eggs. Also, many cats' tummies can't handle dairy, so go easy on the cheesy treats.</p>
    <h2>Foods Cats Shouldnâ€™t Eat</h2>
    <p>Chocolate, Grapes, raisins, Onions, garlic, Macadamia nuts, Bread dough, Alcohol and Artificial sweetener found in sugar-free gum and candy</p>
