    <div class="answers">

    <p>Whiskers are specifically tuned sensory equipment that guide a cat through daily functions. These specialized hairs aid vision and help a cat navigate his environment, providing additional sensory input, much like antennae on insects.</p>
    <h2>What are whiskers?</h2>
    <p>Whiskers are coarser and thicker than regular hair and have roots that are three times deeper. Unlike regular hairs, whiskers do not cover the entire body. on the chin, The exact pattern and location of whiskers vary with breed, but most cats have 12 whiskers that are arranged in four rows on each cheek.</p>
    <h2>Whiskers are radar sensors</h2>
    <p>Whiskers help cats see things that lie right under their noses, by constantly sending information to the brain. As a cat approaches something in his path, he stirs up air currents that bounce back when they hit solid objects. Whiskers detect very faint vibrations caused by these changes in air currents and act like radar detectors</p>
    <h2>Whiskers are body balancers</h2>
    <p>Cats have special sensory organs called proprioceptors located at the ends of their whiskers. The proprioceptors send messages to the brain regarding the position of the body and limbs to keep the cat aware of what every part of his body is doing. This is part of how cats almost always land on their feet</p>
