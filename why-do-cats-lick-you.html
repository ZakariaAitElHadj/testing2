    <center><h1> Why Do Cats Lick You? </h1></center>
    <div class="answers">

    <h2>Your cat is seeking attention.</h2>
    <p>Your cat may have learned very quickly that licking gets attention, as you have likely inadvertently rewarded your cat’s licking by talking to, petting, or in some way interacting with them when they lick you. Some cats even find negative attention, like being reprimanded or pushed away, to be better than no attention.</p>
    <h2>Your cat is displaying kitten-related behavior.</h2>
    <p>Kittens knead and suckle when nursing. If your cat was weaned too early, they may have started licking you as a way to seek the comfort reminiscent of nursing. In this case, your cat may also knead and purr as they lick you.</p>
    <h2>Your cat is expressing her affection for you.</h2>
    <p>Your cat’s licking may be an affiliative behavior, which is a friendly, altruistic behavior. Mothers groom their kittens, and cats may groom one another, which is called allogrooming. This grooming strengthens their social bonds, so your cat may groom you to nurture your relationship.</p>
    <h2>Your cat likes your taste.</h2>
    <p>Your cat may lick your skin or hair to investigate interesting scents or odors, like an appetizing lotion, shampoo, or other topical product. Human perspiration also contains sugar and salts that cats may find appealing.</p>
