    <center><h1> Why Do Cats Knead? </h1></center>
    <div class="answers">

    <p>Kneading is an instinctive trait in cats, who often knead on a soft surface, such as a blanket, other cats, or your lap. It appears to be relaxing and soothingâ€”many cats will purr contentedly, drift off into sleep, or simply zone out and enjoy the motion. Following are some of the more popular theories behind this feline behavior:</p>
    <h2>Kneading to mark territory</h2>
    <p>Cats are strongly driven by scent-related communication, relying on scent markers to claim territory and leave other cats a message. Your cat has scent glands in her paws, and scratching and kneading deposits her scent, letting other animals know she was there..</p>
    <h2>Kneading to convey comfort</h2>
    <p>Happy cats appear to knead to show pleasure. Cats often knead while being petted, or when snuggling into a napping spot. Your cat may also knead on your lap to show her love and contentment, and then settle in for a pat or nap. A stressed cat may knead to create a soothing, calm mood.</p>
    <h2>Kneading to create a resting place</h2>
    <p>Similar to the theory regarding dogs turning in circles before lying down, kneading may help cats create a soft sleeping place. Wild feline ancestors would knead tall grass into cushy piles for a resting place, and this behavior may still be instinctual in our domesticated friends.</p>
