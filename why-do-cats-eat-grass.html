    <h2>Grass Works as a Natural Laxative for Cats</h2>
    <p>Like people, cats can run into certain digestive issues. In these instances, cats sometimes eat grass to help them break down and pass things like fur from grooming to ease constipation.</p>
    <h2>Some Cats Just Like Eating Grass</h2>
    <p>As many cat owners will tell you, there isn’t always an apparent rhyme or reason to some of their unusual behavior. In some cases, cats eat grass simply because they enjoy it and maybe enjoy having a few more greens in their diet.</p>
    <h2>Cats Eat Grass to Supplement Their Diet</h2>
    <p>Grass juice contains folic acid, which is also found in their mother’s milk, and is an essential vitamin that aids in digestion, supports cell growth and helps with the production of hemoglobin. Cats are sometimes drawn to eating grass in an attempt to counteract vitamin deficiency.</p>
